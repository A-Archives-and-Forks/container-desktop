## **IMPORTANT**

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) world has changed and now offers an official cross-platform desktop UI available at [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)
- The container UI space is much more rich today, minimalist solutions exist, such as [Pods](https://github.com/marhkb/pods) or even [Podman TUI](https://github.com/containers/podman-tui) or feature rich ones such as [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)
- Podman **Desktop Companion** is now considered **complete** as opposed to dead.

## Author notes

- Podman **Desktop Companion** is now considered **complete**. It **is not dead**, it is still fun and a place to play with tech.
- _It will not be killed, shut-down or archived unless required, it was **the first cross-platform container UI** before any other existing solution._
- _There is **great pride in this**(mom is proud), no other benefits were obtained, no donations on patreon or ko-fi since inception._
- _It was my first experience with the open source world as a creator and the one that made me **never do it again**, at least not on my own._
- I am still planning to have some future actions in the container world, but time is the enemy!
- It will not receive any further functional updates besides fixing bugs or addressing incompatibilities.

_Thank you to **The Podman Team** and to all the great persons I've met!_
