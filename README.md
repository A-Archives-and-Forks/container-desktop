## Author notes

_Podman Desktop Companion it **is not dead**, it is still fun and a place to play with tech._ <br/>
_It will not be killed, shut-down or archived unless required, it was **the first cross-platform container UI** before any other existing solution._ <br/>
_There is **great pride in this**(mom is proud), no other benefits were obtained(no donations on patreon or ko-fi since inception)._ <br/>
_It was my first experience with the open source world as a creator and the one that made me **never do it again**, at least not on my own._ <br/>
_Thank you to the podman team, it is an excellent group._

* I am still planning to have some future actions in the container world, but time is the enemy!
* Podman **Desktop Companion** is now considered **complete**.
* It will not receive any further functional updates besides fixing bugs or addressing incompatibilities.
