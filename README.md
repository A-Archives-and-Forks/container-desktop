# Podman Desktop Companion

## **IMPORTANT**

* Podman world has changed and now offers an official cross-platform desktop UI, please favor it!
* Everyone is encouraged to use [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)

## Author note

* _Podman desktop companion will not be killed, shut-down or archived unless required, it was **the first cross-platform container UI** before any other existing solution, there is **great pride in this**(mom is proud), no other benefits were obtained(no donations on patreon or ko-fi since inception). It was my first experience with open source world and the one that made me **never do it again**, at least not on my own. Thank you to the podman team, it is an excellent group, I am still planning to have some future actions in the container world, but time is the enemy!_

> **This project is now considered complete and will not receive any further functional updates besides fixing bugs or addressing incompatibilities.**
